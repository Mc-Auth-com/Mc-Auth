## TODO
* Publish Demo-Application
* When an application requests authorization and the user is not logged in, the user can't proceed as intended
* App-Settings: Description looses line-breaks
* Use reCAPTCHA when creating a new app
* Rate-limit icon uploads
* Cards (Login, Settings, App-Settings) go out of bounds when view-port is not high enough
* Tell users that changes have been saved or that an upload failed/succeeded
