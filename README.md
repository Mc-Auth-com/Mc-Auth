# Mc-Auth
Use your Minecraft account to easily log in, without giving your password or email to some random website!
Thanks to Mc-Auth, you can securely log in to third-party services without providing your sensitive data to Mc-Auth!

It aims to be highly transparent to users **and** developers.
Thanks to this transparency, it is easily compliant with most data protection laws
e.g. the **[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)**.

### Another Authentication Service for Minecraft? Really?
I know there is *[minecraft.id](https://minecraft.id/) by inventivetalent* or
*[Minecraft oAuth](https://mc-oauth.net/) by Deftware* (and some more),
but I had something different in mind for my project [SkinDB.net](https://github.com/SkinDB).
They look nice and get the job done, but are lacking information about how your data is treated (e.g. GDPR compliant?).
Another feature I missed was full oAuth2 implementation.
What would normally be done by Mojang as account holders, but they didn't (until now).

So I started reading [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) to understand how oAuth2 works
and has to be implemented => Mc-Auth.com was born!

## How to use Mc-Auth?
If you are a developer, you can check [the documentation](https://github.com/Mc-Auth-com/Mc-Auth/wiki) and find out
more about using Mc-Auth.

If you are a normal Minecraft player and a website or application you are using might find this interesting,
feel free to contact them with a link to this project ‚Äì While making the Minecraft Community a safer place!


## Setup
**You'll need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and
access to a PostgreSQL instance on your machine**

1. Prepare your database by running `./database-setup.sql`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` (needs to be rerun every time the app is updated)
4. `npm run start` Or you can use `npm run dev` to automatically recompile on file changes (not recommended for production)
4. Configure all files inside `./storage` (automatically generated)
6. Type `rs` into the console or restart the process

7. Visit [Mc-Auth-com/McAuth-BungeeCord](https://github.com/Mc-Auth-com/McAuth-BungeeCord) and continue by setting it up
