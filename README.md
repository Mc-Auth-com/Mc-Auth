## TODO
  * Publish Demo-Application
  * When an application requests authorization and the user is not logged in, the user can't proceed as intended
  * App-Settings: Description looses line-breaks
  * Use reCAPTCHA when creating a new app
  * Rate-limit icon uploads
  * Cards (Login, Settings, App-Settings) go out of bounds when view-port is not high enough
  * Tell users that changes have been saved or that an upload failed/succeeded
